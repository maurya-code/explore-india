                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> Meghalaya, the abode of clouds, is one of the most beautiful states in North-East India offering a variety of sights, activities, food and festivals to the tourists. Well known for Cherapunjji, the place which receives one of the maximum rainfall in the world, Meghalaya can mesmerise you with its hills, valleys, lakes, caves and waterfalls which when combined with the beautiful clouds, give it a very serene, beautiful look.
                    Shillong is the capital of Meghalaya, and it’s the most urbanised area you will see in the entire state. Shillong has a lot of leftover British colonial influence that is evident from the plentiful British architecture. Owing to the magnificent lakes all around the town, and the hills surrounding it, Shillong has often been called the Scotland of the East. Cherrapunji is famous for its rainfall, and it used to be the wettest place on Earth before the title was taken over by Mawsynram, which is less than 100 kilometres away from Cherrapunji. The Living Double-decker Root Bridge is a famous attraction in Cherrapunji, where trekking and hiking activities are offered for tourists.

The local folklore has special songs which are sung on auspicious occasions making use of instruments like pipes, drums, flutes and cymbals. The local dance forms include various dances like Lahoo Dance, Doregata and Pomelo Dance. The Doregata Dance is a teasing dance form in which women attempt to knock off their male counterparts' turbans with their heads. If they succeed, it's followed by celebrating the victory with cheer and laughter.</p>

                        <p> Meghalaya celebrates Wangala in the month of November every year. Often referred to as the dance of a hundred drums, the festival marks the end of the period of labour in the hope of yielding a good harvest. Men, women and children from all age groups dress up for the festival and rejoice by dancing on the beats of long cylindrical drums. Dedicated to Satyong, the local god of fertility, Wangala is celebrated across Meghalaya for a duration of one week. The Autumnal Festival, Strawberry Festival and the Ranikor Festival are a few other festivals celebrated in Meghalaya.

                        <p> The Garo and Khasi communities in Meghalaya are known for their weaving skills. Apart from weaving Dakmanda- the fabric of their costumes, they are famous for making Tlieng, a special kind of cane mat. This mat is said to survive the test of time for as long as 20-30 years. Other than this, handwoven cane basket and chairs are unique to take from here. The Khasi tribe is also known for extracting iron ore and manufacturing domestic tools as well as weapons used in warfare.

                        <p>  Amidst the kind of westernisation that has spread all across the world, the state of Meghalaya seems to stand unaffected by this trend. The ethnic and traditional style of the clothes worn here are what defines the exquisiteness of the state. People here are proud of their costumes which is why they are not afraid of showcasing them to the world. Men usually wear a loin outfit coupled with a turban, headgear and jacket. Women of Garo villages wear a blouse and a Lungi-kind of cloth known as Dakmanda, which is a hand-woven cotton fabric. Muga silk from Assam and a clothing strip made of woollen cloth are also quite popular among women.
