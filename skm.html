                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> Sikkim, located in the north-eastern region of India, is a small state with a big heart. Travelling across this Himalayan state is particularly highlighted by the dramatic contouring of the scenery from thick woodlands to colourful meadows to few barren patches to the panoramic views of the snowcapped mountains. Occupied by warm-hearted people offering some of the best hospitality and boasting of magnificent treks, snow activities and scenic views, Sikkim is truly a destination people fall in love with!
                    The third highest peak in the world and jewel of the state, Kanchenjunga is visible from almost anywhere you stand. Characterised by freezing winters and cool summers, the state plays host to a large number of tourists all year round. Until 1975, when it was merged with India, Sikkim functioned as an autonomous kingdom with its own monarchy. Since then, it has become an integral part of India with a distinctive culture which has evolved into a multifaceted one. </p>       <!--      change here   -->

                        <p> Sikkim offers you with a wide variety of thrilling adventures. For trek-lovers, Goechla Trek is the best. Walk through the dense forests and picturesque meadows and enjoy the green-cloaked hills and the trickling stream of waters. River rafting in Teesta river is another adventure which is sure to give you an adrenaline rush. Yak ride near Tsomgo Lake is also exciting. The yaks are covered with vibrant woollen clothes, bells and strings are hung around their neck.  The cable car ride in Gangtok should also be added to your to-do list. It allows you to witness the stunning views from the highest point of the city. Mountain biking on the rugged and dramatic terrains of Sikkim is another activity you must do when in Sikkim. The journey from Gangtok to Rangpo is considered to be the longest mountain biking route in the country.</p>
