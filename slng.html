                                <div class="e1"><p> A beautiful hill station in the abode of clouds, the best time to visit Shillong is between September and May. The weather remains delightful during these months. It does occasionally rain, but it is relatively lesser than in the monsoons season, i.e. between June and August. During the season, the region experiences heavy rainfall, and it might be tough and inconvenient to explore the tourist attractions. The beauty in monsoons is at its peak as the terrain turns into a scenic paradise with lush greenery, lakes, ponds and waterfalls coming to life. It, therefore, can be an off-season location worth a visit for some. </p></div>
