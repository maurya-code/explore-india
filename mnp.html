                        <p>  Every year on the 11th day of the local calendar in Manipur, a religious ceremony called Heikru Hidongba is performed at Sagolband in Imphal. The Hiyang Tanaba Boat race precedes this annual ritual at Thangapat Moat, presented as a tribute to Lord Bijoy Govinda. As per mythology which refers to a boat race between the Laningthou and the Lairembi, the people of Manipur try to enact the same episode (known as hikaba) on the last day of the festival. This seasonal game is usually played only by men and a day before the race the participants offer invitations to the king and Vishnu as per their tradition. The race happens on a grand scale with people coming in huge numbers to cheer the participants
