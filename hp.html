                        <h2>CULTURE AND HERITAGE</h2>
                        <p>Tracing roots to Vedic times, the rich heritage of Himachal Pradesh did find safe retreats from frequent invasions in Himalayan valleys, at isolated kingdoms and at remote habitations. The mighty mountains have always been counted upon as life-giving, where the seeker found shelter and solace. Mystical practices of primitive Shamanism have peacefully existed alongside the evolved faiths of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism for thousands of years.Numerous forts, palaces, temples, monasteries and residences of heritage prominence are found all over the state of Himachal. The thousand year old Buddhist monastery of Tabo in Spiti with its fine wall-paintings and stucco statues has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The village of Pragpur with its age-old and well preserved architecture and cobbled streets has been declared a ‘Heritage village’</p>

                        <h2>Food</h2>
                        <p> Each region or valley has its own set of favourite dishes, cooked in a distinctly different style which makes these feasts very popular at food festivals or when partaking in one during a visit to any of these regions. 
                                The Momo, a Tibetan dish, is a very popular street food readily available in Shimla, Manali, Dharamshala, Dalhousie and other places. 
                                Siddu, a steamed stuffed burger made of wheat flour base, to which yeast is added and eaten with ghee or butter is one of the most popular dishes of Himachal. Other locally popular dishes include Khatta Karai meat of Kangra, and parts of Mandi and Sepu Vadi of Mandi, Patande of Sirmaur, Babru and Nasastha of Shimla.
                                Travelling through the mountain land and soaking up the great views is complemented by the special tastes that one picks up along the route when partaking in the lifestyle and eating habits of the natives.

                        <p>For sheer geographic diversity, few places in the world are as richly endowed as Himachal Pradesh. Rivers cutting through deep gorges, placid mountain lakes, thick forests, acres of scree, snow capped mountains piercing the skyline, sheep scattered like cotton fluffs over alpine pastures; all excite the spirit for outdoor activities, sports and adventure. A stress buster or a challenging adventure, for the beginner or an expert, there is an activity, a sport, an adventure for one and all out there.
