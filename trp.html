The state exhibits a unique blend of traditional tribal culture with a little more modern Bengali culture, giving rise to a harmonious cultural ambience that you will not find anywhere else in the country. Tripura is more than just its breathtaking beauty; it is an illustration of a long and varied legacy of history and tradition, thus promising you a holiday you won’t forget anytime soon.</p>       <!--      change here   -->

                        <p>Tripura is a composite of many cultures from mainland India like Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Christianity as well as local tribal cultures. This gives the state a vast number of festivals that are all celebrated with equal enthusiasm. Garia Puja and Durga Puja are both major festivals dedicated to goddesses of prosperity and regeneration. Dance and song form an important part of the festivities and both tribals and non-tribals participate equally in the celebration. Buddha Purnima is another festival celebrated along with mainland India.  </p>

                        <p>  Festivities form a crucial part in the life of the people of Tripura, and they are incomplete unless accompanied by a corresponding dance to suit the festival. This has given rise to many dances performed by various tribes of Tripura, and they are a perfect blend of tribal and non-tribal cultural practices. The Garia dance is performed during the Garia festival to pray for the success of Jhum cultivation, Hozagiri dance of the Reang community, Bihu dance of the Chakma community and Hai Hak dance of the Halam community are other popular dance forms that tourists can get a glimpse of in this state.

                        <p> The unexplored state of Tripura holds many natural wonders that are waiting to be discovered. Because it is not yet a popular tourist destination, the forests are pristine and untouched by human interference. The unique geography and climate have given rise to lush forests unlike any in India. Many rare and endemic species of animals and plants are found in the state. The Phayre's Langur and Green Imperial Pigeon are two such rare animals that have been designated as the state animal and bird respectively.
