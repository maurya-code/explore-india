                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Haryana is a vibrant state that has managed to retain the best of both worlds- the ancient yet vibrant past and an exciting future to look forward to. It is a state that celebrates art and culture much like the rest of India celebrating its festivals, a panorama of vivid landscapes and exquisite archaeology. Famous not just for its historical sites, its pleasant climate and its quaint landscapes, Haryana is also renowned for being a land of immense cultural diversity, a place often praised for its cordial and amicable ambience, and a state where modern buildings and edifices are as crucial as acres and acres of green fields, vibrant sunsets, and a rich culture that radiates through every nook and cranny of the state. 
                    Often known as the 'Land of Milk and Butter', Haryana has, over time, stood witness to some of the most critical events in the course of Indian history, aptly giving it its title of being the land of lore, myth, and ancient history that still rings loud in the very air of the state. A state that is truly traditional in every way, Haryana is the home to some of the best handicraft and handloom carnivals. </p>       <!--      change here   -->
