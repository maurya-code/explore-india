There is more to Jharkhand than just its scenic landscapes though, with several museums, temples and wildlife reserves scattered around the state. Formerly a part of Bihar, Jharkhand was carved out as a separate state almost two decades ago, thus creating the base for a glorious history, diverse culture and tribal simplicity that the state can now call it's very own.
                    Jharkhand is 'the land of forests' as its name suggests and the state is famous for its rich variety of flora and fauna. The scenic beauty of forests, hills and plateaus from the Lodh Falls leaves an enchanting impression on tourists while the lush green forests that surround the state keeps it green and clean.  </p>       <!--      change here   -->

                        <p> Paitkar Paintings
                            Paitkar paintings are one of the oldest in the tribal handicraft category in the country. Popularly known as scroll paintings, the makers of these paintings are mostly based out of a small village called Amadubi in East Jharkhand. For years, generations of the villagers of this village have been making Paitkars for their livelihood. However, in recent times, due to the lack of exposure, this art form is on the verge of extinction. The local government is trying to revive this old form of storytelling. The theme of these paintings is mostly based on life after death. The artists use palm leaves as their base while the brushes are made from squirrel and goat hair. These paintings are usually associated with Hindu epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana and also recount the deeds of the gods and the goddesses from Indian Mythology.
