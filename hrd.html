                                <div class="e1"><p> Uttarakhand is also called "Dev Bhoomi" (God's land). It is true because it is the place where nature is at its splendor and perhaps that's why it is believed Gods also couldn't resist coming here. Be it "Valley of flowers" or "Queen of Hills" (Mussoorie), various historical or religious places and its culture or tradition, it's a tourist's paradise. 

                                    The people of Uttarakhand speak many languages. The main languages of Uttarakhand are the following:
                                    •	Kumaoni - The Kumaoni language forms the main subgroup of the Pahari language. It is one of the 325 recognized Indian languages, and is spoken by a majority of people in Uttarakhand. It has various dialects. For example, central Kumaoni is spoken in Almora and northern Nainital, north-eastern Kumaoni in Pithoragarh, south-eastern Kumaoni in south-eastern Nainital, etc.
                                    •	Garhwali - Garhwali language is mainly a hilly dialect that originated from Hindi. The Pahari language is known as the language from where Garhwali originated. The Garhwali language is spoken by many people in the state of Uttarakhand. Almost all people who can speak and understand Garhwali can speak and understand Hindi too. However, this is one of the dialects which is shrinking very rapidly and becoming 'out of fashion'.

In Uttarakhand people love making Chutney to compliment the main food. Bhang ki Chutney (made using Hemp Seeds) remains popular due to its tangy taste. Til ki Chutney can be savoured during winter months. Those having sweet tooth must savour the taste of Jhangora Ki Kheer rich with the goodness of milk and dry fruits. Gulgula, made with simple ingredients, is another delicious sweet of Uttarakhand.
